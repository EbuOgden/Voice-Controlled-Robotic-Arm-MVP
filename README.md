# Voice Controlled Robotic Arm

The project purpose is to help disabled people with their daily life routines. <br>

This application helps to control robotic arm with IBM Watson Speech to Text API. <br><br>

The first idea of the project is to help people. We wanted to create a valuable product with the new century notorious technologies to make it easy people's life who have disability. We came up with the idea of robotic arm that can be controlled by voice. <br><br>

<b>Used Technologies</b><br>

<li> Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with Node.js </li>
<li> 2 Servo Motors </li>
<li> IBM's Watson Speech to Text API </li>

<b>Languages</b><br>

<li> Python </li>
<li> JavaScript </li>
<li> HTML5 </li>

<p>We used IBM's Watson Speech to Text API for recognize commands such as "Left, Right, Up, Down" and Degree values such as "30, 50" and we send the commands to Raspberry Pi and we used Raspberry Pi as a server and also as a hardware that can manage the robotic arm.</p><br><br><br>
